If there is Ethereum in the wallet, then the private key will allow a person to control the wallet and spend any wallet balance. Thus, this program tries to find Ethereum private keys that correlate with wallets with a positive balance. However, since it is impossible to know which secret keys control money wallets and which are empty wallets, we have to randomly search for every possible secret key that exists and hope to find one that has a balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This program is essentially a brute force algorithm. It continuously generates random bitcoin private keys, converts the private keys to the corresponding wallet addresses, and then checks the address balance. If a wallet with a balance is found, then the private key, public key and wallet address are saved in a text file rezutus.txt on the user&#8217;s hard drive. The ultimate goal is to randomly find a wallet with a balance of 2,160 possible existing wallets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Search for the Ethereum secret key!
